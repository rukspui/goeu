        Youth unemployment presents a pressing problem in the European Union.
        The social and economic impact of youth unemployment can hardly be measured therefore Europe urgently has to act. </p>
    
    <p>
        SMEs are the backbone of Europeâ€™s economy because it represents 99% of all businesses in the EU and have created 
        85% of all new jobs in the past five years. At this point it is clear that EU has to promote entrepreneurship 
        and self-employment. </p>
    <p>
        Even though, the EU has been working towards increasing the number of entrepreneurs in Europe via e.g. 
        The Entrepreneurship Action Plan, the goal of becoming entrepreneur still remain unachievable for many 
        potential young people. </p>
    
    <p>
        Encouraging young people to become entrepreneurs can potentially give a boost to the economy while driving 
        down the number of jobless youngsters. Each young person who is considering starting up in business could be 
        an opportunity for EU to get back on track and stay on the track of growth, innovation and development. 
        However, many opportunities just remain opportunities instead of actions because the information does not 
        or hardly reach the young people. </p>
    
    <p>
        Many young people are not aware of programmes such as Erasmus+ Entrepreneurship that intends to promote young 
        entrepreneurs. These people are afraid of starting their businesses and often find themselves in a situation where 
        they cannot turn to anyone for advice. A staggering 92% of people say that they rely on peer recommendation when 
        they are seeking for advice. However, it is not easy for potential entrepreneurs to discover people in their 
        surroundings who have struggled or are still struggling with same issues. </p>
